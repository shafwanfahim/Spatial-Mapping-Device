# Spatial-Mapping-Device 

Developed a Spatial Mapping Device to capture data from a time-of-flight sensor and generate a comprehensive 3D
visualization of the surrounding environment. Utilized C and Assembly to program an MSP432E401Y microcontroller, enabling efficient control of servo motor and sensor
for data acquisition.Employed I2C and UART communication protocols in C to facilitate seamless data processing and transmission. Created a Python program for visualization using PySerial and Open3D. Orchestrated the hardware integration of buttons, lights, motors, and sensors, ensuring reliable data collection.
